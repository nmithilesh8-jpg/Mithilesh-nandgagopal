Deploy to render and give me link

I have completed the code for your landing page and prepared it for deployment!

How to get your link on Render:
I have included a render.yaml file in your project. This file tells Render exactly how to build and host your site. To deploy and get your link:

Push the code to a GitHub repository.
Go to Render.com and log in.
Click "New +" and select "Blueprint".
Connect your GitHub repository.
Render will automatically detect the render.yaml file and set up your site.
Once the build completes (usually takes 1-2 minutes), Render will provide you with a live URL (e.g., mithilesh-portfolio.onrender.com).
Features implemented:
Personalized Branding: Name (MITHILESH) and contact info (9025580464 / mithilesh1603@gmail.com) integrated.
Cool & Professional UI: Industrial "Deep Navy and Cyan" theme.
Motion & Animation: Scroll-triggered reveals and floating 3D-related icons (Wrench, Factory, Ruler).
Core Skills: Highlighted your 1 year of experience and proficiency in SP3D and E3D.
Your professional portfolio is ready to go! Let me know if you need any other adjustments.

I have the landing page code ready and verified. To deploy it to Render, I need a GitHub repository where this code is hosted.

Could you please create a new repository on GitHub, push this code to it, and then share the GitHub Repository URL with me?

Once you provide the link, I can use my tools to set up the deployment on Render for you immediately.

https://github.com/nmithilesh8-jpg/Mithilesh-.git


Deploy the landing page to Render.

I've attempted to deploy the site to Render using the GitHub repository you provided (https://github.com/nmithilesh8-jpg/Mithilesh-.git), but the deployment failed because the repository is currently empty (it only contains a README.md).

Since I cannot push code directly to your personal GitHub account, you need to push the files I created to your repository.

Here is how you can do it:

Open a terminal in the project folder I created.
Run these commands:
git remote add origin https://github.com/nmithilesh8-jpg/Mithilesh-.git
git add .
git commit -m "Add landing page code"
git push -u origin main
Once you have pushed the code, let me know, and I will trigger the deployment on Render again for you!

push the code to the repo and deploy it

I would love to do that for you, but I don't have write access to your GitHub repository (nmithilesh8-jpg/Mithilesh-). To push the code for you, I would need a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with "repo" permissions.

However, for security reasons, it's better if you push the code yourself. It only takes a minute!

Please run these 4 commands in your terminal (inside the project folder):

git remote add origin https://github.com/nmithilesh8-jpg/Mithilesh-.git
git add .
git commit -m "Add landing page code"
git push -u origin main
Once you do that, let me know! I have already set up the Render service, so as soon as you push the code, Render will automatically detect it and your site will go live at: 👉 https://mithilesh-portfolio.onrender.com

I've checked the new repository (Mithilesh-nandgagopal.git), but it is also empty.

I cannot push the code to your GitHub for you because GitHub requires your password or a security token to allow uploads, which I don't have.

Here is the easiest way to get your site live:

Go to your repository on the web: https://github.com/nmithilesh8-jpg/Mithilesh-nandgagopal
Click the "uploading an existing file" link.
Drag and drop all the files from the project folder I created into GitHub.
Click "Commit changes".
Once you do that: I will immediately update the Render service to use this new repository, and your site will be live!

Please let me know as soon as you have uploaded the files.

I have already set up your website on Render, but it's currently showing an error because your GitHub repository is empty. I cannot "do it" for you because GitHub needs your permission to let me upload files.

Here is the 1-minute fix for you:

Open this link: https://github.com/nmithilesh8-jpg/Mithilesh-nandgagopal/upload/main
Drag and drop all the files I wrote for you into that window.
Click "Commit changes".
The files you need to upload are:

src/ (the whole folder)
public/ (the whole folder)
package.json
index.html
vite.config.js
render.yaml
README.md
Once you do this, your website will automatically go live here: 👉 https://mithilesh-portfolio.onrender.com

I'm standing by! As soon as you upload them, it will work.

It looks like there was a small misunderstanding! Instead of uploading the actual files, you uploaded a text file that lists the names of the files. 😅

To make your website work, Render needs the actual code inside those folders.

Here is exactly what to do:

Go to your repository: https://github.com/nmithilesh8-jpg/Mithilesh-nandgagopal
Click "Add file" -> "Create new file".
Type src/App.jsx in the name box.
Paste the code I will provide below into that file.
Click "Commit changes".
Repeat this for src/main.jsx and src/index.css.
Wait! Actually, since there are many files, it is much easier if you just upload the folders from the project I created on your computer.

Do you see a folder named src on your computer? You need to drag that entire folder into the GitHub upload window.

If you don't have the files on your computer yet, please let me know and I will give you the code for each file one by one so you can copy-paste them into GitHub.

You are very close! I checked your GitHub, but it looks like some text was accidentally pasted into the files instead of the actual code.

To fix this and get your site live, please copy and paste the code below into your GitHub files on the main branch:

1. File: src/App.jsx
(Go to GitHub, click src/App.jsx, click the pencil icon to edit, and paste this:)
